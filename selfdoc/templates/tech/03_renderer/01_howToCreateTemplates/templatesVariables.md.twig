# Templates variables

There are several variables available in each processed template.

1) Firstly, these are built-in twig variables, for example `_self`, which returns the path to the processed template.

2) Secondly, variables with collections of processed programming languages are available in the template (see [a]LanguageHandlerInterface[/a]). For example, when processing a PHP project collection, a collection [a]PhpEntitiesCollection[/a] will be available in the template under the name <b>phpEntities</b>

3) Thirdly, all variables specified in **Front Matter** are automatically converted into template variables and are available in it
