## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate the effort of security researchers and the general public in helping us maintain the security of our
software. Hereâ€™s how you can report a vulnerability:

1. **Creating an Issue**: Visit our GitHub repository
   and [create an issue](https://github.com/bumble-tech/bumble-doc-gen/issues) detailing the vulnerability. Please label
   the issue as "security" for quicker identification.
2. **Details Matter**: When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible. This includes steps to reproduce,
   potential impact, and any other information that might help us understand the severity and nature of the
   vulnerability.
